  <h6>By Lisa Hallman </h6>
  <p>I am a Hunter College graduate who loves hiking, international travel, cooking, and playing guitar. </p>
  <p>I am taking this credential for a number of reasons. First, I want to know how to adequately develop, create, and deploy web pages.</p>
  <p>Second, I am taking this credential to learn a new skill and to demonstrate to a future employer I am able to  learn new technologies in a collaborative environment.</p>
  <p>Third, I love to learn and do new things. Fourth, the length of the learning process, for this new skill, is relatively short before I return to work in the NYC.</p>
